title: Community Hangout – Synereo's Extensibility Model

We’re hosting a community hangout tomorrow, March 4th, at 21:00 GMT. Synereo addresses the needs of multiple communities. 

In the last couple of hangouts we talked about serving the needs of performing artists and other members of the creative classes. In this hangout, we’ll talk about addressing the needs of another creative community: developers! Developers are the lifeblood of the Internet. They make bits sing and dance. Naturally, we want to make it possible for them to work their magic with Synereo. So, this week's hangout is all about extensibility, and how developers can shape, mold, and extend Synereo to build apps that we, the founders, didn’t even think about.
